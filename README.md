# Rentals

# Considerations
- Using db to keep track of points, rentals and have inventory. Keeping it simple so
using simple string names as identifiers for films, customers; no foreign keys, constraints etc

Database population has been simplified to keep focus on the application itself

Assume that there are multiple copies of films, so no testing for availability
